# Honeyguide_sound
## Honeyguides out there honey guiding Honeyhunters

This is a Shiny app showing interactive map

To follow the whole pipeline, visualization of the results, I prepared an interractive shiny web application which includes all the scripts and visualized outcomes. I will update this read me file as well as the dashboard once I have solutions for further projects. Enjoy scrolling through the interractive dashboard!

You may download the repository and run the Shiny app in R/RStudio on your local system, or run the following commands in your Terminal or R console:


````
```
#First install shiny package
install.packages("shiny")
# R-console: 
shiny::runGitHub("Honeyguide_sound","fariedd")

# Terminal: 
runGitHub("Honeyguide_sound","fariedd")
```
