</h3>

    Once harvesting is complete, it is customary to reward the honeyguide for its assistance. All interviewees reported actively rewarding the honeyguide, often with wax combs with brood, and sometimes wax combs with honey. This is reportedly done to reciprocate the help of the honeyguide as well as to encourage it to guide them again in future. 81% of interviewees believed that the honeyguide is capable of retaliating against anyone who does not reward it, by leading them to a dangerous animal such as a snake or a beesâ€™ nest with a snake living inside it.
