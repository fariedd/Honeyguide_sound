    Honey-hunting in Eswatini is a prevalent recreational activity among young boys who herd cattle. 
    Honey-hunters widely cooperate with honeyguides, and often use sound, ranging from generic sounds to 
    specialised whistles made on hollowed fruits and modern plastic items like deodorant balls and PVC pipes,
    along with spoken words of praise. Honey-hunters consistently reward honeyguides with wax and brood or honey,
    many believing that failing to do so may result in being led to dangerous animals in the future. 
    Young boys learn honey-hunting skills not only from their elders but also from peers, particularly their fellow 
    cattle-herding colleagues. Honey-hunting has reportedly declined from its past prevalence due to more education 
    and job opportunities in cities and reduced suitable habitats with sufficient honeyguides and honeybees. Beekeeping 
    with box hives does occur but is less common in Eswatini.<br><br>
